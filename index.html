           <p>A preview of a sound experience built within the Unity environment. Inspired by projects such as Routine or Dead Space. An attempt to imitate a thrilling experience and demonstrate integration of audio via Audiokinetic Wwise. A simple enviroment was built, consisting of a hallway model, with each section planned to work with the sound design and visuals influence in order to induce specific emotions. Visual factors such as intensity of colours, width and length of the rooms, variations in presence of lighting and it's strength were taken into account.â€‹Main intention was to create a simple, but smart envirnemtn in short period of time. Smart in a sense of possibilities for further audio composition and integration. Audio integration cosisted of - basics player realted events, such as footsteps also in relation to environment, such as opening doors. Scripts and Animation Controllers.

           <p>A side project focused more on the soundtrack aspect, rather than presentation of integration capabilities. Composition uses a visual trailer from Capcom's Resident Evil. Idea was to keep it simple, in order to provide a rather linear approach to not distract from visuals but to put viewer into this 'mesmeric' state and create tension. There are several factors within the structure.

            Most of this has been done in FLS, with both synthethizers and previously recorded audio. The sounds were processed and adjusted.</p>
