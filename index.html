				<h3> 1979</h3>
				
                <p></p>
				
				<p class="about__description">A project under development within the Unreal Engine, drawing inspiration from the icons of slasher film. 1979 is meant to tell a story of a group of friends who try to escape to safety, separated and caught in a snow blizzard, after their party in a 'summer' lodge at Camp Violet gets rudely interrupted. The preview contains a sourced soundtrack <i>"Everybody Wants To Rule The World" by <b>Tears For Fears</b></i> used solely for the testing and presentational purposes. <br><h4>Recent</h4>Implementation of basic AI to search for and chase the player. Integration of atmospheric chase sequence audio with various responses. Introduction of parameters that affect the sound based on distance between player and the killer.</br>
					 <br><h4>Current</h4>In process of producing variety of soundtracks to trigger based on factors such as proximity of AI or detection status. Production and post processing of the soundscape. Introducing elements such as ducking as a part of enhanced soundscapes during critical moments. Conceptualising the audio structure to improve immersion and allow for an experience in which audio guides the player to safety. </br>

				<h2 class="section__title about__title">Audio Integration, <i>Hallways</i></h2>
				<h3> Hallways</h3>
				
                <p></p>
				
				<p class="about__description"> Hallways is a preview of a sound experience built within the Unity Engine environment. It draws inspiration from projects such as Dead Space or Routine. An attempt to produce an immersive experience and demonstrate integration of audio via Audiokinetic Wwise, along with composition and processing of the soundscape.<span id="dots">..
					
				</span><span id="more"> <br>The reasoning behind most of the decision was based on the will to create an intriguing and enveloping environment, uncomfortable and intrusive in its nature. The space was meant to suppress and confine the viewer with its narrow corridors, heavy air, dim exposure and sound highlighting and augmenting the immersion. Low and High frequencies were introduced to incite a variety of emotions, mostly based on the primal characteristics of these sounds. The soundtrack develops and adjusts to the situation, supplemented by subtle events nudging the viewer throughout the experience.</br> <br>Models for the project consist of the general hallway model, which is sculpted to resemble a corridor with windows, visual panels and certain additional elements such as wiring. Each room was modeled with different features. A separate and integral part were the door models, along with simple armatures and animations. Models were prepared in Blender and imported into Unity. </br> 
					<br>Audio consisted of both, foley and source synthetized sounds. General work and assembly of Foley was conducted in Audition. Further composition, mixing and mastering was done within FLS.</br>
					<br>Audiokinetic Wwise was used to integrate audio into the project. Apart from elements essential to the sound design such as footsteps, the Hallways project was structured with consideration of several areas. Areas of design such as structural, environmental, atmospheric and supplementary were recognized. Televison screens’ hum and door sounds were part of environmental design, with door sounds being interactive. Atmospherics were sculpted around a separately produced soundtrack and low/high frequencies. Supplementary area of the sound design process consisted of ‘final touches’ on the reverb zones, portals and some game parameters altering. </br>
					<br>Unity was used simultaneously with Wwise during the audio implementation. The work in Unity revolved around incorporating Wwise elements such as play events, details of attenuation, positioning. As well as working with the animation controllers to introduce Blender animations. Scripting was used for integration of footsteps, door interactions and more. </br>
